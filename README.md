# Downloading the scripts
To download three Python scripts, you need to make sure you have Python3 on your Mac. If you have old Python version, please update it. 
The latest release for downloading: https://github.com/JoyKuan/DS560-HW2/releases/latest

# Description
Visualization of the linear function is help you create a scatter chart including all the data points lie on the line given by equation y=3x+6 with all values of x from x dataset and all values of y from y dataset and save the graph of the result into the disk. 
Follow by following tasks:
1. Generate 1000 random numbers over the range 0-100
2. Generate new numbers from the original 1000 using the equation y=3x+6
3. Visualize the results

You will see two datasets(.csv) which are saved in your disk and the graph of the equation y=3x+6.

# Technologies
* Python 3.7
* Matplotlib 3.3.2

# Setup
Before to run plot_equation.py, you need to install Matplotlib:

+ Install Matplotlib with Anaconda Prompt
```bash
conda install matplotlib
```
+ Install Matplotlib with pip
  
  Use the package manager pip to install matplotlib
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

# How to run Python scripts
System: macOS

Open a command-line and take note of the path of the Python script in Finder. Use the cd command to navigate to the folder containing the Python file. If you copide the pathname before, paste the pathname after the cd command. If you hava python3 version, and then run them in order. Type the following command to execute three scripts:
```bash
$ python3 generate_input_x.py
$ python3 generate_output_y.py
$ python3 plot_equation.py
```

# Output Files
If there is no problem after you run all three scripts in order, you will see three output files in your disk.
If there exists some problems, you will need to check your Python installation.

**Output Files:**
1. x_dataset.csv
2. y_dataset.csv
3. equation_graph.png

# Jupyter Notebook
See notebook [visualization_equation.ipynb](https://github.com/JoyKuan/DS560-HW2/blob/master/visualization_equation.ipynb).

This Python Notebook that calls the three scripts, generate_input_x.py, generate_output_y.py and plot_equation.py, in order. You can follow the instructions mentioned in Notebook, and then you will see the graph of a linear equation y=3x+6.

# Execute GitHub project(DS560-HW2) on a virtual environment step by step
System: MacOS

## Step 1. Clone DS560-HW2 into your local repository 
Clones the repository, DS560-HW2, into a newly created directory with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called DS560-HW2, you can do so like this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoyKuan/DS560-HW2.git
```

## Step 2. Create a blank environment on the local repository and name it dsci560H4 
1. Install virtualenv on the local repository on MacOS.
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
2. Create a virtual environment
Generally, the commands is
```bash
python3 -m venv env 
```
In this project, the command is 
```bash
python3 -m venv dsci560H4
```
The second argument is the location to create the virtual environment. You can use "env" or change "env" into your name of the environment(e.g. dsci560H4). 
  
3. Activate your virtual environment and install the dependencies for executing the random number generator script
Before you start installing or using packages in the virtual environment youâ€™ll need to activate it. 
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
And then install the package, pandas, for executing the random number script (generate_input_x.py).
In order to save the dependencies, you need to execute the command which records an environment's current package list into requirements.txt.
In the requirements.txt file that contains a list of commands for pip that installs the required versions of dependent packages.
If you did not install the dependencies, you will see the empty content in requirements.txt file.
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```






  
  
  
  
  
Step 2. Activate the environment and install package for executing the random
